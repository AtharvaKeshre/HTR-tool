# Handwritten Text Recognition Tool

## Overview

This project is a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) tool developed using Python and the Flask web framework. The tool leverages Tesseract OCR for optical character recognition, enabling the conversion of handwritten and printed text from images into a digital format. The primary focus is on extracting characters such as alphabets, digits, and symbols from input images, whether they are handwritten documents or printed text.

## Introduction

Despite the prevalence of digital writing tools, there remains a preference for traditional note-taking with pen and paper. This project addresses the challenges associated with handwritten text, making it easier to store, access, and share in a digital format. The goal is to develop a tool that takes images containing handwritten or printed text as input and extracts characters for further digital processing.

## Problem Statement

The need for converting handwritten text to digital form is identified due to the manual conversion of handwritten documents into a digitized format for more efficient processing.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a machine learning-based tool in Python to convert images of handwritten text into a digital format.
2. Enable the conversion of both handwritten and printed documents into a digital format.

## Solution Proposed

Handwritten character recognition, a field in artificial intelligence, is employed to detect and convert characters in various sources, including paper documents and pictures, into machine-encoded form. The implementation relies on two main factors: feature extraction and classification algorithms.

## Implementation

The tool is implemented using Python, Flask, and Tesseract OCR. Feature extraction is employed to reduce the dimensionality of raw data, making it more manageable for processing. Classification, a supervised learning approach, is used to train the tool to classify new observations based on the input data.

## Feature Extraction and Classification

Feature extraction is the process of reducing raw data to more manageable groups for processing. Classification, a supervised learning approach, involves training the computer program to classify new observations based on the input data.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn autonomously from data without explicit programming. The tool focuses on developing programs that can adapt to new data.

## Python

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language known for its readability and extensive libraries. The project utilizes Python for its machine learning capabilities, as well as Flask for web development.

## Dependencies

- Flask
- pytesseract
- Tesseract OCR
- [ocr_core](#) (Include a brief description or link to the ocr_core module)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Flask application.

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Access the tool through a web browser at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
5. Upload an image containing handwritten or printed text to initiate the recognition process.
